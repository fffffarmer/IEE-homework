Overview of the Program</strong></span></p><p>Aiming at the development of technical and sustainable solutions that minimize the impact of human activities on the environment, the International Master Program in Environmental Science, Engineering and Management covers the areas of environmental engineering and science, environmental management and planning.</p><p>The program is designed to train students with solid theoretical and systematic professional knowledge and the skills in the field of environmental engineering and management, and to prepare to approach the forefront of environmental engineering and management with a combination of coursework and research components. Highly flexible learning is a distinguishing feature of this program that allows the development of either intensive or broadened abilities of the students.</p><p><img width="300" height="225" alt="" src="/publish/enven/6285/20141022103510920383939/image001.jpg"/></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 54, 93); font-size: 16px;"><strong>2. Application Guidance </strong></span><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>2.1 Degree Offered </strong><br/></p><p>Master of Science<br/></p><p>Master of Science in Environmental Science and Engineering (M.S.-ESE)<br/></p><p>Each student must complete required coursework to fulfill the credits requirement and qualify for degree conferral. A thesis research is an essential part of the degree.<br/></p><p>(Each student must complete the required coursework and a thesis research to qualify for degree conferral.)</p><p><strong>2.2 Professional Courses Offered in English</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Course Requirements:</strong><br/></p><p>Students are required to take Chinese language courses, professional courses, internship and academic activities. The program offers a comprehensive professional education and research in areas including water/wastewater treatment, air pollution control, solid waste control, environmental chemistry, environmental microbiology, environmental planning and management and environmental policy, etc. The courses are scheduled to permit either intensive study in a specific area, or interdisciplinary studies across a variety of fields. Comprehensive introductory courses are given to provide a common basis of understanding for those with differing backgrounds. Professional courses are selected in consultation with the graduate coordinator or a faculty advisor to meet each student’s academic and career goals. An internship is designed for students to gain professional experiences in a company or environmental protection organization in China. The typical period of this program is 2 years.</p><p><strong>Courses offered in each semester：<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Spring Semester:</strong><br/></p><p>Advanced Environmental Chemistry<br/>Advanced Wastewater Treatment<br/>Restoration Ecology and Application<br/>Global Environmental Issues<br/>Hazardous Waste Disposal Technology<br/>Environmental Transport Processes</p><p><strong>Autumn Semester:</strong><br/></p><p>Fundamentals of Environmental Biotechnology<br/>Advanced Water Distribution System and Management<br/>Advanced Water Supply Engineering<br/>Environmental Management and Policy<br/>Integrated Solid Waste Management<br/>Air Pollution Control Technology<br/>Biofilms: fundamentals to applications<br/>Challenges for Advanced Water technology: Global Seminars<br/></p><p>Note: For the completion of thesis, relevant courses offered by other schools or departments can also be selected. Most courses given in Chinese are also available for international students.<br/></p><p><strong>2.3. Internship&nbsp;</strong><br/></p><p>According to the coursework, the two-year master’s program requires an internship/on-site survey. During the on&ndash;site survey, each student will design and conduct a scientific survey on China-specific issues with the help from supervisors. A diverse number of practical opportunities are available in water plants, wastewater treatment plants, waste treatment and recycling facilities, environmental companies, environmental protection bureaus, multinational corporations and other national or international organizations. During the on-site survey, students will gain exposure in methods and techniques adopted by natural and social scientists to identify, analyze and interpret environmental issues. The on-site survey will be in either Beijing or other parts of China, and usually conduct in the summer after the first academic year.</p><p><strong>2.4. Thesis </strong><br/></p><p>Students are required to complete an independent research project, supervised by a faculty member who shares the same interest in this particular topic or issue that is related to his/her own research. A written thesis research proposal and a formal presentation are required in the second term. Students are required to submit a thesis in English with an executive summary in Chinese. A final oral defense is required.</p><p><strong>2.5. Qualification of Applicants</strong><br/></p><p>Applicants must be non-Chinese citizen with a valid passport.<br/></p><p>Applicants for Master programs should hold a Bachelor degree, or equivalent degree, or will receive a Bachelor degree when enroll, majoring in Environmental Science and Engineering, Environmental Economics and Management, Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Biology, or other relevant fields.&nbsp;<br/></p><p>The Bachelor degree should be a formal four-year program with at least 100 credits or 30 courses.<br/></p><p>The overall average of required courses should be ≧70%. No more than 5 courses have scores lower than 60%. If the transcript only shows GPA, please clarify the calculation method from actual score to GPA and whether the GPA meets the requirement in the personal statement.<br/></p><p>All the applicants should have basic knowledge in calculus (≧4 credits), physics (≧4 credits), chemistry (≧4 credits), and biology (≧2 credits).
